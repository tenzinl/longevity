    "text": "1 Introduction\nLife expectancy is a statistical projection of the number of years a person can expect to live and is an important measure of a population’s general health and well being. It is a mortality measure that can provide significant insights into a country’s social and economics conditions, as well as the effectiveness of it’s healthcare systems. Research into life expectancy can potentially highlight areas that may need intervention to address any disparities and inequalities that may exists. Additionally, it can guide efforts to improve health outcomes by addressing areas where change may be needed in public health.\nIn the last century, life expectancy has steadily increased in most countries, and is a result of ongoing process in improvements in health[1]. The advancement in technology, medical health, and higher standard of living have contributed to this positive trend. According to Riley(2001), increasing longevity can be achieved by improving six key areas: public health, medicine, wealth and income, nutrition, behavior, and education[2]. In a 2020 study by The Journals of Gerontology, wealth was noted as the most crucial factor in longevity and health[3]. Wealth allow access to better healthcare and healthier lifestyles,which can lead to longer, healthier lives.\n\n\n2 Research Context and Purpose\nWhile the link between wealth and life expectancy has been established, the interplay between economic and and environmental factors across countries worldwide is what this study aims to explore. By analyzing the relationship, this research hope the members of the general population who are interested in topics involving health and longevity can identify key factors influencing life expectancy and make informed decisions to adopt healthier lifestyles.\nIn this project, the research question I aim to examine is: How do economic and environmental factors affect life expectancy across different countries?",

The data set provides life expectancy, health, immunization, economic, and demographic data for 179 countries from 2000 – 2015. The data set contained 21 variables and 2864 observations.\nThis project will explore the following variables:\nDependent Variable:\nLife expectancy: Average life expectancy, in years, for both men and women.\nIndependent Variables:\nGDP per capita: Gross domestic product per US dollars, per capita. Alcohol consumption: Consumption recorded per capita in liters of alcohol. Immunization Index: Represents % of coverage of vaccination among 1 year olds. BMI: Average BMI of population which is weight (kg)/ height Developed vs Developing: Each country’s defining itself as “developed” or “developing” according to World Trade Organization.",

Although it appears to suggest higher alcohol consumption is associated with higher life expectancy, but other variables may explain the variation is life expectancy. This could suggest that alcohol consumption may correlate with wealthier countries which generally have higher life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot includes regression line for each region and provides trends in life expectancy as it relates in alcohol consumption. As observed previously, there is a weak positive correlation; however, the regression lines vary by region. For Africa, the regression line is fairly flat, which suggest alcohol consumption has little to no impact on life expectancy. On the other hand, regions with higher life expency, such as North America and Europe, display a positive slope indicating a moderate increase in life expectancy as alcohol consumption increases.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project aimed to examine how economic and environmental factors affect life expectancy. Analysis of GDP, alcohol consumption, BMI, and immunization revealed how these variables influence life expectancy. Higher GDP, healthy BMI, and higher immunization generally correlated with a higher life expectancy. Interestingly, alcohol consumption also revealed a positive correlation with high life expectancy, although the relationship was nuanced and region dependent. The implications of these findings can help reveal global disparities. The results also suggest economic growth, improving health care (like immunization), and a healthy lifestyle that can lead to a health BMI, are all factors that improved life expectancy.\nOne of the limitations for this project was that it relies on a single data set with limited variables. The data set also only provided information only up to 2015, and may not reflect a shift in life expectancy over the past decade. For future research, incorporating additional variables, such as health care access, education, and lifestyle can provide a more holistic view of variables affecting life expectancy.\n\n5 References\nData: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated\n[1]Vaupel JW. 2010.
